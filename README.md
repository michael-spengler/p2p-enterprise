# Peer 2 Peer Enterprise
Potential skeleton for Peer 2 Peer Enterprise  

Using GitHub Action based deployment (on push to master branch):
https://peer2peer-enterprise.org 

# Backend 
Deno based backend - https://github.com/michael-spengler/p2p-enterprise/blob/main/server/p2p-enterprise-server.ts

# Frontend
Vue.js - We prepared two potential templates which you might move to the client folder in order to have a quick start experience :)
1. https://github.com/nikolockenvitz/vue-boilerplate-vue2-router-vuex-vuetify
2. https://github.com/FischerRene/vue-boilerplate-vue2-router-vuex

# Dependent on Systems
1. [Peer 2 Peer Tasks](https://peer2peer-tasks.org) 
2. [Peer 2 Peer People](https://peer2peer-people.org)

# Quality Criteria
How fast can someone delegate a task?
How fast is this task completed on average?
How happy are the ones who delegated the task?
How happy are the ones who solved the task - e.g. with the clarity of the task description and the reward for it?

# Values & Spirit
Shall be built in the spirit of Web3  
1. high degree of decentralization (e.g. deployed as permaapp via arweaveapps)  
2. high degre of interoperability (e.g. via linked data - [the solid approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy5eKqM8-OA))  
3. high cohesion and loose coupling of modules  

# Background to Values and Spirit
Re-building the decentralized web - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy5eKqM8-OA 
 
# Options / Ideas
1. Use the [Community.xyz P2P Token](https://community.xyz/#vyDjA2UggLj12tcFR-lKAo1kKaZyNeAM2twEJ62xkco/tokens) as currency --> current owners will be available during the Hackathon and will hopefully be happy to share their stakes :) 
2. Deploy and use a new ERC20 Token as currency
3. Use Fiat Money - connected via old school payment solutions like PayPal etc. - for the people living in non-crypto countries 


# Contribution
Contributions are welcome :)

# History
Peer 2 Peer Enterprise as it is before the Hackathon is integrated / bound to only one issue / task platform (e.g. a company internal github instance). We would like to have a more open general Peer 2 Peer Enterprise. Therefore we offer this as a challenge.
